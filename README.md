# Currency Converter API

A simple Java API for converting currencies that allows you to:
* create your own exchange rate tables,
* add exchange rates manually or download them from an external source,
* add forex spreads,
* convert between any two currencies from the defined exchange rate table.

The project was developed as an exercise in the **TDD approach**.

External libraries used:
* JUnit 5 and Mockito for unit tests,
* JSON.simple for handling JSON files.

Plans for further development:
* implement a builder pattern for easier creation of exchange rate tables,
* prepare documentation using Javadoc.

The project was inspired by an [article on the Samouczek Programisty blog](https://www.samouczekprogramisty.pl/testy-jednostkowe-z-junit5/).
